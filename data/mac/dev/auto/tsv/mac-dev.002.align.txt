靴声响到门口，那人走了进来。	The boots reached the door, and came on into the room.
韦小宝从桌底下瞧出去，见那靴子不大，来人当是个和自己差不多年纪的男孩，当即放心，将烧饼放入口中，却也不敢咀嚼，只是用唾沫去浸湿烧饼，待浸软了吞咽。	Trinket peeped out from behind the table-cloth. From the size of his footwear, the new arrival seemed to be a boy like himself. He heaved a sigh of relief, and put the pancake in his mouth. He didn't dare to take a bite out of it, but softened it with his saliva, and then swallowed it silently down.
只听得咀嚼之声发自桌边，那男孩在取糕点而食，韦小宝心想：“也是个偷食的，我大叫一声冲出去，这小鬼定会吓得逃走，我便可大嚼一顿了。”	Meanwhile he could hear noisy munching coming from the table above him. The new boy was clearly tucking in. 'Why, he's just another scavenger like me!' thought Trinket to himself. 'I'll jump out and scare him off, then I can carry on eating to my heart's content.'
又想：“刚才真笨，该当把几碟点心倒在袋里便走。	His thoughts ran on: 'What a fool I was just now! I should have stuffed a whole plateful in my pocket and buggered off!
这里又不是丽春院，难道短了什么，就定是把帐算在我头上？”	This isn't like home. They wouldn't miss a little thing like that, or expect me to pay for it!'
忽听得砰砰声响，那男孩在敲击什么东西，韦小宝好奇心起，探头张望，只见那男孩约莫十四五岁年纪，身穿短打，伸拳击打梁上垂下来的一只布袋。	All of a sudden there was a series of noisy thumps. The new scavenger had started hitting something. His curiosity aroused, Trinket poked his head out from under the table. What he saw was a boy of fourteen or fifteen, in a short gown, punching at one of the bags that hung from the beam.
他打了一会，又去击打墙边的皮人。	After a while, the boy moved across and started attacking one of the oxhide cut-outs.
那男孩一拳打在皮人胸口，随即双臂伸出，抱住了皮人的腰，将之按倒在地，所用手法，便似昨日在酒馆中所见到那些摔交的满人一般。	He struck the figure first on the chest with one fist, then reached forward with both hands and grappled it by the waist, forcing it to the ground. It was very much the same sort of technique as the one used by the Manchu wrestlers in the inn the previous day.
韦小宝哈哈一笑，从桌底钻了出来，说道：“皮人是死的，有什么好玩？	Trinket chuckled to himself and darted out from beneath the table. 'Why fight a dummy!' he cried.
我来跟你玩。”	'Why not try me?'
那男孩见他突然现身，脸上又缠了白布，微微一惊，但听他说来陪自己玩，登时脸现喜色，道：“好，你上来！”	The other boy's first reaction was one of alarm, at the sight of this strange apparition with its head swathed in bandages. But alarm quickly turned to delight when he realized that he had found a sparring partner. 'Very well!' he replied. 'On guard!'
韦小宝扑将过去，便去扭男孩的双臂。 那男孩一侧身，右手一勾，韦小宝站立不住，立时倒了。	Trinket sprang forward and seized the boy's arms, intending to give him a sharp twist, but the boy turned smartly, and hooked him with his right foot, sending Trinket crashing to the floor.
那男孩道：“呸，你不会摔交。 ”	'You're hopeless!' he jeered. 'You obviously don't know the first thing about wrestling!'
韦小宝道：“谁说不会？” 跃起身来，去抱他左腿。	'Who says I don't!' protested Trinket, leaping to his feet again and reaching for the boy's left leg.
那男孩伸手抓他后心，韦小宝一闪，那男孩便抓了个空。	The boy made a grab for his back, but this time Trinket dodged in time and the boy seized a handful of air.
韦小宝记得茅十八在酒馆中与七名大汉相斗的手法，突然左手出拳，击向那男孩下颚，砰的一声，正好打中。	Trinket recalled Whiskers' fight with the seven wrestlers at the inn, and shot out a quick left that caught the boy hard, fair and square, on the lower cheek.
那男孩一怔，眼中露出怒色。	The boy stood there stunned for a few seconds, and a momentary look of anger came into his eyes.
韦小宝笑道：“呸，你不会摔交！”	'You're hopeless!' cried Trinket with a grin. 'You obviously don't know the first thing about wrestling.'
那男孩一言不发，左手虚晃，韦小宝斜身避让，那男孩手肘斗出，正撞在他的腰里。	The boy said nothing, but feinted with his left fist. Trinket fell for it and dodged, and as he did so, the boy's elbow came crashing across into his midriff and winded him completely.
韦小宝大叫一声，痛得蹲了下来。	He crumpled up and fell to the ground in excruciating pain.
那男孩双手从他背后腋下穿上，十指互握，扣住了他后颈，将他上身越压越低。	The boy now came at Trinket from behind, slipped both hands under his arms and laced his hands together around his throat, throttling him, and pressing him harder and harder down on to the ground.
韦小宝右足反踢。 那男孩双手猛推，将韦小宝身子送出，拍的一声，跌了个狗吃屎。	Trinket kicked frantically with his right foot, but then the boy loosed his hands and gave him a terrific shove which sent him rolling across the room like a puppy chasing its own tail.
韦小宝大怒，翻滚过去，用力抱住了男孩的双腿，使劲拖拉，那男孩站立不住，倒了下来，正好压在韦小宝身上。	Trinket was furious. He came tumbling back, wrapped both arms round the boy's legs, and tugged at him with all his might. The boy crashed down right on top of him.
这男孩身材比韦小宝高大，立即以手肘逼住韦小宝后颈。	He was quite a bit bigger than Trinket, and had soon succeeded in throttling him again and pinning him to the ground.
韦小宝呼吸不畅，拼命伸足力撑，翻了几下，终于翻到了上面，反压在那男孩身上。	Trinket began to choke, thrashed out with his feet to extricate himself, and finally managed to wriggle on top of the boy and hold him down.
只见他人小身轻压不住对方，又给那男孩翻了上来压住。	He was too light to maintain the upper hand for long, however, and soon the boy was back on top of him again.
韦小宝极是滑溜，放开男孩双腿，钻到他身后，大力一脚踢中他屁股。 那男孩反手抓住他右腿使劲一扯，韦小宝仰面便倒。	Ever a crafty fighter, Trinket now let go of the boy's legs, got behind him, and landed him a good kick on the backside. The boy quickly grabbed his right leg and tugged at it, sending Trinket crashing down on his back.
那男孩扑上去扠住他头颈，喝道：“投不投降？”	The boy leapt astride him, pinned his head to the floor, and cried: 'Well! Surrender?'
韦小宝左足钩转，在那男孩腰间擦了几下，那男孩怕痒，嘻的一笑，手劲便即松了。	Trinket had meanwhile managed to hook his left foot round the boy's waist, and started to rub it up and down the small of his back. The boy, it transpired, was extremely ticklish, and he couldn't help giggling, and loosened his grasp.
韦小宝乘机跃起，抱住他头颈。	Trinket seized his chance, leapt up, and pinned his opponent down by the throat.
那男孩使出摔交手法，抓住了韦小宝后领，把他重重往地下一摔。	The boy now used a standard wrestling ploy, gripping Trinket by the back of the neck and pulling him to the ground with considerable force.
韦小宝一阵晕眩，动弹不得。	Trinket went out like a light. When he regained consciousness, he found that he was temporarily immobilized.
那男孩哈哈大笑，说道：“服了么？”	The boy burst out laughing. 'Well? Had enough? Give in?'
	But Trinket was not finished yet.
韦小宝猛地跃起，一个头锤，正中对方小腹。	He eventually succeeded in jumping up and landing a head-butt right in the boy's midriff.
那男孩哼了一声，倒退几步。	The boy groaned and staggered back a few steps.
韦小宝冲将上去，那男孩身子微斜，横脚钩扫。	Trinket lunged after him, the boy leant a little to one side, put out a leg, and brought him tumbling to the floor.
韦小宝摔将下来，狠命抱住了他大腿。 两人同时跌倒。	Trinket reached out frantically as he fell, clutching at the boy's legs, and the two of them went down together.
一时那男孩翻在上面，一时韦小宝翻在上面，翻了十七八个滚，终于两人互相扭住，呼呼喘气，突然之间，两人不约而同的哈哈大笑，都觉如此扭打十分好玩，慢慢放开了手。	They struggled for a while, each one gaining the upper hand for a moment, then going under, ringing the changes more than a dozen times, until finally they were in a complete deadlock, panting and staring fixedly at each other. And then suddenly, at exactly the same moment, they both burst out laughing. There was something about the clinch they were in that struck them both as terribly funny. Slowly they let go.
那男孩一伸手，扯开了韦小宝脸上的白布，笑道：“包住了头干么？”	The boy reached out a hand and began removing the bandages from Trinket's face. 'What did you want to wrap your face up for?'
韦小宝吃了一惊，便欲伸手去夺，但想对方既已看到自己真面目，再加遮掩也是无用，笑道：“包住了脸，免得进来偷食时给人认了出来。”	Trinket was about to snatch the bandages back, when he reflected that the boy had already seen most of his face and that it would achieve nothing. 'I didn't want anyone to recognize me taking the cake.'
那男孩站起身来，笑道：“好啊，原来你时时到这里偷食。”	'I see,' said the boy, chuckling and standing up. 'So you make a habit of coming here and taking food, do you?'
韦小宝道：“时时倒也不见得。”	'No, I don't,' said Trinket.
说着也站了起来，见那男孩眉清目秀，神情轩昂，对他颇有好感。	As he rose to his feet, he stole a closer glance at his opponent: there was something at once impressive and attractive about the boy's features, a clearness of brow, a noble look in the eyes, an expression in the face, that drew Trinket towards him.
那男孩问道：“你叫什么名字？”	'What's your name?' asked the boy.
韦小宝道：“我叫小桂子，你呢？”	'Laurel,' replied Trinket. 'And yours?'
那男孩略一迟疑，道：“我叫…… 叫小玄子。	After a moment's hesitation the boy replied: 'Mine's . . . People call me Misty.
你是哪个公公手下的？”	Which of the Goong-goongs do you work for?'
韦小宝道：“我跟海老公。”	'I'm with Hai Goong-goong.'
小玄子点了点头，就用韦小宝那块白布抹了抹额头汗水，拿起一块点心便吃。	Misty nodded, and used Trinket's bandages to mop the sweat from his brow. He helped himself to a cake.
韦小宝不肯服输，心想你大胆偷食，我的胆子也不小于你，当即拿起一块千层糕，肆无忌惮的放入口中。	Trinket was not going to be outdone. If this young fellow could continue calmly scavenging, so could he. He popped another slice of layer cake nonchalantly into his mouth.
小玄子笑了笑，道：“你没学过摔交，可是手脚挺灵活，我居然压你不住，再打几个回合，你便输了。”	'I can see you've never done any wrestling,' laughed Misty. 'But you're a quick mover all the same! You managed to get away that time. A few more goes and I'd have had you, though—'
韦小宝道：“那也不见得，咱们再打一会试试。”	'Is that right?' protested Trinket. 'Come on then: let's see—'
小玄子道：“很好！”	'At you!'
两人又扭打起来。	The two of them set to again.
小玄子似乎会一些摔交之技，年纪和力气又都大过韦小宝，不过韦小宝在扬州市井间身经百战，与大流氓、小无赖也不知打过了多少场架，扭打的经验远比小玄子丰富。	Misty clearly knew a few wrestling moves, and was the older and stronger of the two. But Trinket had the benefit of years of experience in the streets of Yangzhou, where he'd had to deal with all manner of bullies and thugs, big and small, and in this respect he was definitely Misty's superior.
总算他记得茅十八的教训，而与小玄子的扭打只是游戏，并非拼命，什么拗手指、拉辫子、咬咽喉、抓眼珠、扯耳朵、捏阴囊等等拿手的成名绝技，倒也一项没使。	But for one reason or another (partly Whiskers' lecture, partly because this was, after all, only 'play-fighting' and not in deadly earnest) he didn't avail himself of a single one of the dubious tricks at which he excelled: the finger-twist, the pigtail-pull, the throat-bite, the eye-poke, the ear-yank, the grip-o'-the-balls.
这么一来，那就难以取胜，扭打几回合，韦小宝终于给他骑在背上，再也翻不了身。	As a result he eventually came off the loser again, with Misty sitting on his back, and no hope of throwing him off.
小玄子笑道：“投不投降？”	'Surrender?'
韦小宝道：“死也不降。”	'Never!'
小玄子哈哈一笑，跳了起来。	Misty burst out laughing and jumped up.
韦小宝扑上去又欲再打。 小玄子摇手笑道：“今天不打了，明天再来。	Trinket went for him again, but this time Misty shook his head. 'No more for today! Tomorrow, if you like.
不过你不是我对手，再打也没用。”	But I don't see the point: you'll never be able to beat me!'
韦小宝不服气，摸出一锭银子，约有三两上下，说道：“明天再打，不过要赌钱，你也拿三两银子出来。”	Trinket was not having this. He pulled a piece of silver from his pocket, about three taels' worth: 'Tomorrow we fight for money! You'd better bring three taels yourself!'
小玄子一怔，道：“好，咱们打个彩头。	Misty seemed somewhat taken aback by this but then concurred. 'All right.
明天我带银子来，中午时分，在这里再打过。”	We fight for money. I'll bring my stake. See you here at noon tomorrow.'
韦小宝道：“死约会不见不散，大丈夫一言既出，…… 马难追。” 这“驷马难追”的“驷”他总是记不住，只得随口含糊带过。	'Live or die!
小玄子哈哈大笑，说道：“不错，大丈夫一言既出，…… 马难追。”	Excellent kungfu! My word is my wand!' cried Trinket, and Misty burst out laughing. 'It certainly is!'
说着出屋而去。	And with that he left the room.
韦小宝抓了一大把点心，放在怀里，走出屋去，想起茅十八与人订约比武，虽在狱中，也要越狱赴约，虽然身受重伤，仍是誓守信约，在得胜山下等候两位高手，这等气概，当真令人佩服。	Trinket helped himself to a big handful of cakes and stuffed them inside his jacket. Then he too left the room. As he went, he found himself thinking of Whiskers' heroic stand at Victory Hill: now there was a man! Whiskers had pledged his word to fight, and nothing could have stood between him and the fulfilment of that pledge, not the walls of his prison cell, not even his own wounds.
他听说书先生说英雄故事，听得多了，时时幻想自己也是个大英雄、大豪杰，既与人订下比武之约，岂可不到？	How many times Trinket had sat listening to the storytellers' tales, and how many times he'd dreamed of one day being a hero himself—Trinket the Brave Man and True! Now, he'd said he would fight, and there could be no going back! He had pledged his word!
心想明日要来，今晚须得回到海老公处，于是顺着原路，慢慢觅到适才赌钱之处。	And if he was to be a man of his word, he would have to forget about escape—at least for the time being. He would have to go back to the old eunuch that evening.
先前向着右首走，以致越走越远，这次折而向左，走过两道回廊，依稀记得庭园中的花木曾经见过，一路寻将过去，终于回到海老公的住所。	He therefore decided to retrace his steps to the room where they had been gambling earlier in the day — and from there he took a direction opposite to the one he had taken earlier (which had led him deeper and deeper into the mansion), followed two covered walkways, vaguely remembered one or two shrubs he had passed by in the courtyards on the way, and somehow, by hook or by crook, navigated his way back to the old eunuch's quarters.
他走到门口，便听到海老公的咳嗽之声，问道：“公公，你好些了吗？”	As he drew near the entrance, he heard the old fellow coughing. 'Goong-goong? Are you feeling any better?'
海老公沉声道：“好你个屁！	'Better my arse!' muttered the eunuch.
快进来！”	'Get a move on, will you!'
韦小宝走进屋去，只见海老公坐在椅上，那张倒塌了的桌子已换过了一张。	Trinket hurried over to him. Old Hai was sitting at a table (the broken one had been replaced).
海老公问道：“赢了多少？”	''How much did you win?'
韦小宝道：“赢了十几两银子，不过…… 不过……”	'I won a dozen taels,' replied Trinket.
海老公道：“不过怎么？”	'But I—' 'You what?' snapped the eunuch.
韦小宝道：“不过借给了老吴。”	'I lent them to Wu.'
其实他赢了二十几两，除了借给老吴之外，还有八九两剩下，生怕海老公要他交出来，不免报帐时不尽不实。	In actual fact he'd won twenty and lent twelve to Wu: the remaining eight he wished to hang on to.
海老公脸一沉，说道：“借给老吴这小子有什么用？	Old Hai scowled at him. 'What do you want to go lending money to that Wu fellow for?
他又不是上书房的。	He doesn't even work in the Upper Library, dammit!
怎么不借给温家哥儿俩？”	You could at least have lent to one of the Wen brothers!'
韦小宝不明缘由，道：“温家哥儿没向我借。” 海老公道：“没向你借，你不会想法子借给他吗？	Trinket didn't follow this at all. 'But they didn't ask me for a loan.' 'Then you should have found a way to offer one.
我吩咐你的话，难道都忘了？”	Have you forgotten everything I ever told you?'
韦小宝道：“我……我昨晚杀了这小孩子，吓得什么都忘了。	'It's just that. . . what with killing that boy yesterday, I can't seem to think straight, it must have gone clean out of my mind.
要借给温家哥儿，不错，不错，你老人家确是吩咐过的。”	I ought to have lent the money to one of the Wen brothers, that's right, I remember now, you told me.'
海老公哼了一声，道：“杀个把人，有什么了不起啦？	Old Hai humphed. 'What's so alarming about killing?
不过你年纪小，没杀过人，那也难怪。	I suppose you're only a child though, you've never done it before.
那部书，你没有忘记？” 韦小宝道：“那部书…… 书…… 我…… 我……”	Now, about the book— I hope you haven't forgotten.' 'The book?'
海老公又哼了一声，道：“当真什么都忘记了？”	Old Hai humphed again. 'Have you forgotten everything?'
韦小宝道：“公公，我…… 我头痛得很，怕…… 怕得厉害，你又咳得这样，我真担心，什…… 什么都胡涂了。”	'Goong-goong, I... I've got this terrible headache . . . and I'm so worried about your cough ... I just can't keep my mind on anything!'
海老公道：“好，你过来！	'Very well. Come over here!'
“韦小宝道：“ 是！”	'Yes, Goong-goong!'
走近了几步。	Trinket walked a few steps closer.
海老公道：“我再说一遍，你倘若再不记得，我杀了你。”	'I'm going to repeat it for you once more. Forget this time, and I shall kill you.'
韦小宝道：“是，是。” 心想：“你只要再说一遍，我便过一百年也不会忘记。”	'Yes, Goong-goong!' piped Trinket, thinking to himself, 'Just say it once, and I'll never forget it, not in a hundred years!'
海老公道：“你去赢温家哥儿俩的银子，他们输了，便借给他们，借得越多越好。	'Listen: you're to win money from the Wen brothers. Then you're to lend them money, the more the better.
过得几日，你便要他们带你到上书房去。	Then, after a few days you're to ask them to take you to the Upper Library.
他们欠了你钱，不敢不依，如果推三阻四，你就说我会去跟上书房总管乌老公算帐。	They'll have to say yes, if they owe you money. If they try to fob you off, you tell them that I'll report them to the Chief Librarian;
温家兄弟还不出钱来，自会乘皇上不在……”	I'll tell him they refuse to pay their debts, and ask him to wait for His Majesty to—'
韦小宝道：“皇上？”	'His Majesty?'
海老公道：“怎么？”	'What?'
韦小宝道：“没…… 没什么。”	'Oh . . . nothing.'
海老公道：“他们会问你，到上书房干什么，你就说人望高处，盼望见到皇上，能够在上书房当差。	'If they ask you why you want to go to the Upper Library, you say that you're longing for a glimpse of His Majesty, so you just want a chance to perform some little errand there.
温家兄弟不会让你见到皇上的，带你过去时，皇上一定不会在书房里，你就得设法偷一部书出来。”	Of course the Wen brothers won't let you see His Majesty; when they take you, His Majesty won't even be in the Upper Library. That's when you find a way to steal the book . . .'
韦小宝听他接连提到皇上，心念一动：“难道这里是皇宫？	Something was beginning to fall into place in Trinket's mind, with all these references to 'His Majesty'. 'Could this be the Palace, the Forbidden City itself!' he thought silently to himself.
不是北京城里的大妓院？	'Have I been wrong all this time, about it being the number one whore-house in Peking?
啊哟喂，是了，是了，若不是皇宫，哪有这等富丽堂皇的？	Aiyeeh! Of course! That must be it!
这些人定是服侍皇帝的太监。”	These people are all eunuchs working for the Emperor. . .'
韦小宝虽然听人说过皇帝、皇后、太子、公主，以及宫女、太监，但只知道皇帝必穿龙袍，余人如何模样就不知道了。	As a boy, Trinket had heard people talk about the Emperor, the Empress, Princes and Princesses, Palace Ladies, Palace Eunuchs, but he hadn't the faintest idea what these grand beings actually looked like. All he knew was that the Emperor wore a Dragon Robe.
他在扬州看白戏倒也看得多了，不过戏台上的那些太监，服色打扮跟海老公、老吴他们全然不同，手中老是拿着一柄拂尘挥来挥去，唱的戏文没一句好听。	In Yangzhou he'd seen all sorts of plays, but the eunuchs on stage were never dressed anything like Old Hai, or his new gambling friend Wu. And the stage eunuchs always held those long horsehair fly-whisks, and kept waving them around in the air.
他和海老公相处一日，又和老吴、温氏兄弟赌了半天钱，可不知他们便是太监，此刻听海老公这么说，这才渐渐省悟，心道：“啊哟，这么一来，我岂不变成了小太监？”	And anyway, he had never understood a word of what they were singing. So this was what real Palace Eunuchs were like! 'Cripes!' he cried silently to himself. That means I've become a little Palace Eunuch myself!
海老公厉声道：“你听明白了没有？”	I've lost my balls!' 'Did you take in what I said just now?' growled Old Hai.
韦小宝道：“是，是，明白了，要到皇…… 皇帝的书房去。”	'Yes, Goong-goong, yes! I've got to go to His Majesty's Upper Library!'
海老公道：“到皇上书房去干什么？	'And why have you got to go?
去玩吗？”	To play?'
韦小宝道：“是去偷一部书出来。”	'To steal a book.'
海老公道：“偷什么书？”	'Which book?'
韦小宝道：“这个…… 这个…… 什么书…… 我…… 我记不起了。”	'I... I... can't remember.'
海老公道：“我再说一遍，你好好记住了。	'I'll tell you once more. And this time, don't forget.
那是一部佛经，叫做《四十二章经》，这部经书模样挺旧的，一共有好几本，你要一起拿来给我。	It's a Sutra, called the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections. It's very old. There are several copies of it. Just bring them all to me.
记住了吗？	Got it?
叫什么？”	Now—what's it called?'
韦小宝喜道：“叫做《四十二章经》。”	'The Sutra in Forty-Two Sections.'
海老公听出他言语中的喜悦之意，问道：“有什么开心？”	Trinket sounded very pleased with himself. 'What are you so happy about?' snapped the old eunuch.
韦小宝道：“你一提，我便记起了，所以高兴。”	'I'm just happy about. . . about remembering it the minute you mentioned it again.'
原来他听海老公说要他到上书房去“偷书”，“偷”是绝不困难，“书”却难倒了人。	In actual fact, when Old Hai had spoken of stealing a book, Trinket's heart had sunk. The 'stealing' part was no problem; it was the 'book' part that presented what seemed at first like an insurmountable obstacle. The trouble was that Trinket could barely read.
他西瓜大的字识不了一担，要分辨什么书，可真杀了头也办不到，待得听说书名叫做《四十二章经》， 不由得心花怒放， “章经”是什么东西不得而知，“四十二”三字却是识得的，五个字中居然识得三个，不禁大为得意。	He couldn't decipher more than a word or two, let alone book titles. Then he heard the eunuch say that the book was the Sutra in Forty-Two Sections, and his heart leapt: what the word Sutra looked like he had not the foggiest notion, but numbers were something he could read. So the second part of the title was a walk-over! Wasn't that sufficient reason to be pleased?
海老公又道：“在上书房中偷书，手脚可得干净利落，假如让人瞧见了，你便有一百条性命也不在了。”	'Now,' went on Old Hai, 'if you go stealing books from the Upper Library, you've got to be very smart, very careful. If anyone spots you, you're as good as dead. A hundred times over.'
韦小宝道：“这个我理会得，偷东西给人抓住了，还有好戏唱吗？” 灵机一动，说道：“不过我决不会招你公公出来。”	'I know,' said Trinket. He suddenly thought of something, and added: 'If I did get caught, I'd never dream of dragging you into it, Goong-goong!'
海老公叹道：“招不招我出来，也没什么相干了。”	Old Hai heaved a strangely unconcerned sigh. 'Drag me in or drag me out, it's all the same to me . . .'
咳了一阵，说道：“今天你干得不错，居然赢到了钱。	He had another coughing fit, and went on: 'You've done quite well today. At least you've won something.
	What did the others think?
他们没起疑心罢？”	Were they suspicious?'
韦小宝笑道：“嘿嘿，没有，那怎么会？”	Trinket chortled. 'Oh no, why should they be?'
想要自称自赞一番，终于忍住。	He was about to boast, but thought better of it.
海老公道：“别躲懒，左右闲着没事，便多练练。”	'Well then, don't sit around doing nothing. Eat your lunch, and if you've no jobs to do, go and practise with the dice!' 'Yes, Goong-goong!'
韦小宝应了，走进房中，只见桌上放着碗筷，四菜一汤，没人动过，忙道：“公公，你不吃饭？	Trinket walked across to the dining-table, where bowls and chopsticks had been laid, four dishes and a soup, all untouched. 'Goong-goong, aren't you eating?
我装饭给你。”	Let me serve you!'
海老公道：“不饿，不吃，你自己吃好了。”	'I'm not hungry. You go ahead.'
韦小宝大喜，来不及装饭，夹起一块红烧肉便吃，虽然菜肴早已冷了，吞入饥肠，却是说不出的美味，心想：“这些饭菜不知是谁送来的。	Trinket was delighted, and without bothering to fill his bowl with rice, he attacked a dish of stewed meat. The food was cold, but he was hungry, and to him it was indescribably delicious. 'I wonder where they get the food from?
这种小事别多问，睁大眼睛瞧着，慢慢的自会知道。”	Oh well, I'd better not ask too many questions, just keep my eyes open and pick things up one at a time.
又想：“倘若这里真是皇宫，那么老吴、温家哥儿，还有那个小玄子都是太监了。	If this really is the Forbidden City, then old Wu and the Wen brothers and little Misty must all of them be eunuchs.
却不知皇帝老儿和皇后娘娘是怎么一副模样，总得瞧个明白才是。	I wonder what the actual Emperor and Empress look like? I must try and get a look.
回到扬州，嘿嘿，老子这说起来可就神气啦。	Then one day when I'm back at home, ha ha! I can tell people who I've seen.
	Just imagine the look on their faces!
茅大哥不知能不能逃出皇宫去？	'I wonder if Whiskers got out safe?
赌钱时没听到他们说起拿住了人，多半是逃出去啦。”	They didn't say anything about someone getting caught when we were gambling . . . Most probably he got away all right.'
吃完饭后，只怕海老公起疑，便拿着六颗骰子，在碗里玎玲玲的掷个不休，掷了一会，只觉眼皮渐重，昨晚一夜没睡，这时实在疲倦得很了，不多时便即睡着了。	When he had finished eating, he went through the motions of practising with the dice so as not to arouse the old eunuch's suspicions, throwing them noisily across the table. After a while his eyelids began to feel heavy. He hadn't slept all night. In minutes he was sound asleep.
这一觉直睡到傍晚时分，跟着便有一名粗工太监送饭菜来。	He slept till evening, when a junior eunuch brought in their supper.
韦小宝服侍海老公吃了一碗饭，又服侍他上床睡觉，自己睡在小床上，心想：“明日最要紧的是和小玄子比武，要打得赢他才好。”	Trinket waited on Old Hai as he ate a bowl of rice, and then helped him to bed. Afterwards he went to lie down on the smaller bed, thinking to himself: 'Tomorrow, whatever else happens, I must win my fight with Misty!'
闭上眼睛，回想茅十八在酒馆中跟满洲武士打架的手法，却模模糊糊的记不明白，不禁有些懊悔：“茅大哥要教我武艺，我偏不肯学，这一路上倘若学了来，小玄子力气虽比我大，又怎能是我对手？	He lay there, trying to remember Whiskers' fight with the wrestlers in the tavern. He wished he could remember the details more clearly. 'If only I'd taken old Whiskers up on his offer! With him as my teacher I could have learnt a thing or two on the way up here, and then I could have put Misty in his place—even though he is stronger than I am.
明天要是再给他骑住了翻不过来，输了银子不打紧，这般面子大失，我这‘小白龙’韦小宝在江湖上可也不用混啦。”	If he gets me on the ground again tomorrow, I'll die of shame! Little White Dragon—forget it! I'd never dare show my face among the Brothers!'
突然心想：“满洲武士打不过茅大哥，茅大哥又不是老乌龟的对手，何不骗得老乌龟教我些本事？”	Suddenly a thought occurred to him. 'The wrestlers were no match for Whiskers; but Whiskers was no match for Old Turtle-head—why don't I get him to teach me a few moves?'
当即说道：“公公，你要我去上书房拿几本书，这中间却有一桩难处。”	He asked the old eunuch at once: 'Goong-goong, if you want me to go stealing books from the Upper Library, there's just one problem.'
海老公道：“什么难处？”	'What's that?'
韦小宝道：“今儿我赌了钱回来，遇到一个小…… 小太监，拦住了路，要我分钱给他，我不肯，他就跟我比武，说道我胜得过他，才放我走。	'Well, after today's game, I met this . . . little eunuch, who stood in my way and asked me to give him some of my winnings.
我跟他斗了半天，所以…… 所以连饭也赶不及回来吃。”	I wouldn't, so we ended up fighting. That's why I was so late for lunch.'
海老公道：“你输了，是不是？”	'He beat you, presumably.'
韦小宝道：“他又高又壮，力气可比我大得多了。	'He was bigger than me, and stronger.
他说天天要跟我比武，哪一日我赢了他，他才不来缠我。”	He says I've got to fight with him every day, until I can beat him. Then he'll let me off.'
海老公道：“这小娃娃叫什么名字？	'What was the little fellow's name?
哪一房的？”	Which part of the Palace was he from?'
韦小宝道：“他叫小玄子，可不知是哪一房的。”	'He's called Misty. I don't know where he's from.'
海老公道：“定是你赢了钱，神气活现的惹人讨厌，否则别人也不会找上你。”	'You must have been acting too pleased with yourself after your win—that's probably what annoyed him.'
韦小宝道：“我不服气，明儿再跟他斗过，就不知能不能赢。”	'I won't let him get away with it! I'm going to fight him tomorrow! But I just wonder if I can beat him.'
海老公哼了一声，道：“你又在想求我教武功了。	Old Hai humphed. 'You want to wangle some moves out of me, don't you?
我说过不教，便是不教，你再绕弯儿也没用。”	The answer's no, so it's no use trying.'
韦小宝心中暗惊：“老乌龟倒聪明，不上这当。”	'Clever Old Turtle-head!' thought Trinket, silently cursing to himself.
说道：“这小玄子又不会武功，我要赢他，也不用学什么武艺，谁要你教了？	This little fellow Misty,' he began again, out loud, 'he wasn't such a good fighter really. I wouldn't need to learn much to beat him. I don't need you to teach me, either.
今儿我明明已骑在他身上，只不过他力气大， 翻了过来。	I had him on the ground today, it's just that he was too strong for me: he managed to buck me off.
明天我出力掀住他，这家伙未必就能乌龟翻身。”	Tomorrow I'll get a proper grip on him. That should fix the little bugger!'
他这一天已然小心收敛，不说一句粗话，这时终于忍不住说了一句。	He had been trying so hard all day to keep his language clean.
海老公道：“你想他翻不过来，那也容易。”	'If you want to stop him bucking you, that's easy!' said Old Hai.
韦小宝道：“我想也没什么难处，我明天一定牢牢掀住他肩头。”	'I didn't think it would be hard. I just get him in a good shoulder grip, then—'
海老公道：“哼，掀住肩头有什么用？	'That's no good!
能不能翻身，全仗腰间的力道，你须用膝盖抵住他后腰穴道。	Bucking comes from the lower back. You have to knee him on the vital point in the small of his back.
你过来，我指给你看。”	Come over here and I'll show you.'
韦小宝一骨碌从床上跃下，走到他床前，海老公摸到他后腰一处所在，轻轻一按，韦小宝便觉全身酸软无力。	Trinket hopped out of bed and was at Old Hai's bedside in a trice. The old eunuch felt around in the small of his back and pressed lightly. Trinket felt his whole body go limp.
海老公道：“记住了吗？”	'Can you remember that?'
韦小宝道：“是，明儿我便去试试，也不知成不成？”	'Yes, I'll try it out tomorrow. Let's hope it works.'
海老公怒道：“什么成不成？	'Works?
那是百发百中，万试万灵。”	Of course it will work. It's absolutely foolproof!'
又伸手在他头颈两侧轻轻一按。	Old Hai reached out his hand and pressed lightly on either side of Trinket's neck.
韦小宝“啊”的一声叫了出来，只觉胸口一阵窒息，气也透不过来。	Trinket let out a gasp of pain. He had a choking sensation in his chest, and could hardly breathe.
海老公道：“你如出力拿他这两处穴道，他就没力气和你相斗。”	'Get him on these two points,' said Hai, 'and he'll have no strength to fight with.'
韦小宝大喜，道：“成了，明儿我准能赢他。”	Trinket was pleased as punch. 'Well, that's it then! Tomorrow, I win!'
这个“准”字，是日间赌钱时学的。	
回到床上睡倒，想起明天“小白龙”韦小宝打得小玄子大叫“投降”，十分得意。	Trinket went back to bed, and fell asleep dreaming of Misty surrendering to the Little White Dragon!
次日老吴又来叫他去赌钱。	Wu came to fetch him again the following morning.
那温家兄弟一个叫温有道，一个叫温有方，轮到两兄弟做庄时，韦小宝使出手段，赢了他们二十几两银子。	It was the Wen brothers' turn to be bankers. Trinket had soon managed to win over twenty taels off them. It was a bad day for the bank altogether.
他兄弟俩手气又坏，不到半个时辰，五十两本钱已输干了。	In less than an hour they had to pay out fifty taels, which was all they had.
韦小宝借了二十两给他们，到停赌时，温家兄弟又将这二十两银子输了。	Trinket lent them another twenty, and by the end of the day's play that was all gone too.
韦小宝心中记着的只是和小玄子比武之事，赌局一散，便奔到那间屋去。	All Trinket could think about was his appointment with Misty. As soon as the gambling was over, he hurried to the 'cake room'.
只见桌上仍是放着许多碟点心，他取了几块吃了，听得靴子声响，只怕来的不是小玄子，心想先钻入桌底再说，却听得小玄子在门外叫道：“小桂子，小桂子！”	The table was piled high again with good things to eat, and this time Trinket tucked in with a vengeance. Then he heard the flip-ploy of cloth boots again. He ducked under the table, just in case it turned out to be someone other than Misty. 'Laurel!
韦小宝跃到门口，笑道：“死约会，不见不散。”	Laurel!' It was Misty's voice calling from the doorway. Trinket sprang out, and with a big grin on his face, called back: 'Live or die!'
小玄子也笑道：“哈哈，死约会，不见不散。” 走进屋子。	'I live, you die!' laughed Misty, striding into the room.
韦小宝见他一身新衣，甚是华丽，不禁颇有妒意，寻思：“待会我扯破你的新衣，叫你神气不得！”	Trinket noticed at once that he was wearing a completely new outfit, and couldn't help feeling jealous. 'Huh!' he muttered to himself. 'Just you wait! You won't be so pleased when I've made a big rip in that smart gown of yours!'
一声大叫，便向他扑了过去。	He let out a great war cry and threw himself straight into the attack.
小玄子喝道：“来得好。” 扭住他双臂，左足横扫过去。	'Excellent kungfu!' cried his opponent, grappling him with both arms, and delivering a swinging kick with his left foot.
韦小宝站立不定，晃了几下，一交跌倒，拉着小玄子也倒了下来。	Trinket lost his balance, tottered and fell, bringing Misty down with him. As Trinket rolled and spun round, he managed to pin Misty face down on the floor.
韦小宝一个打滚，翻身压在小玄子背上，记得海老公所教，便伸手去拿他后腰穴道，可是他没练过打穴拿穴的功夫，这穴道岂能一拿便着？	He remembered Old Hai's little demonstration, and felt for the vital point in the small of Misty's back. But he had never done this sort of thing before, and it was hard to find the point at his very first attempt.
拿的部位稍偏，小玄子已然翻了过来，抓住他左臂，用力向后拗转。	Misty meanwhile had spun round, gripped Trinket's left arm, and twisted it back.
韦小宝叫道：“啊哟，你不要脸，拗人手臂么？”	'Hey!' screamed Trinket, 'that's not fair! Twisting my arm like that!'
小玄子笑道：“学摔交就是学拗人手臂，什么不要脸了？”	That's what wresding's all about!' laughed Misty. 'Who says it's not fair!'
韦小宝趁他说话之时一口气浮了，全身用力向他后腰撞去，将背心撞在他头上，右手从他臂腋里穿了过来，用劲向上甩出。	Trinket took advantage of the fact that Misty was busy speaking and momentarily off his guard, to launch a counter-attack. He brought his head down with all his might on to Misty's back, shot his right hand under his armpit, and flung him up into the air as hard as he could.
小玄子的身子从他头顶飞过，拍的一声，掉在地下。	Misty went flying over his head and landed widi a crash on the ground.
小玄子翻身跳起，道：“原来你也会这招‘羚羊挂角’。”	He leapt to his feet again, crying: 'So you know the Bucking Antelope too!' Trinket had never even heard of the Antelope.
韦小宝不知“羚羊挂角”是什么手法，误打误撞的胜了一招，大为得意，说道：“这‘羚羊挂角’算得什么，我还有许多厉害手法没使出来呢。”	He'd just been improvising and thrashing around, and somehow or other had managed to outwit his opponent. He was pretty chuffed. 'The Antelope is nothing!' he cried. 'I know plenty more, and they're a lot worse.
小玄子喜道：“那再好也没有了，咱们再来比划。”	You haven't seen anything yet!' 'Perfect!' cried Misty in delight.
韦小宝心道：“原来你学过武功，怪不得打你不过。	'Go to!' Trinket engaged in a quick moment's reflection: 'Misty has obviously had lessons—that's why he keeps getting the better of me. But that's no problem.
可是你使一招，我学一招，最多给你多摔几交，你的法子我总能学了来。”	All I have to do is watch his moves and copy them. He can throw me a few times— I'll soon get the hang of it.'
眼见小玄子又扑将过来，便也猛力扑去。	Misty started coming at him.
不料小玄子这一扑却是假的，待韦小宝扑到，他早已收势，侧身让开，伸手在他背上一推。 韦小宝扑了个空，本已收脚不住，再给他顺力推出，登时砰的一声，重重摔倒。	Trinket lunged back, but it was a feint: Misty stepped aside, let Trinket surge on, and chopped him on the back with the side of his hand. Trinket was unable to rein himself in, and went crashing to the ground.
小玄子大声欢呼，跳过来骑在他背上，叫道：“投不投降？”	Misty gave a great cry of delight, leapt forwards, and planted himself astride Trinket's back. 'Surrender?'
韦小宝道：“不降！”	'No! Never!' protested Trinket,
欲待挺腰翻起，蓦地里腰间一阵酸麻，后腰两处穴道已被小玄子屈指抵住，那正是海老公昨晚所教的手法，自己虽然学会了，却给对方抢先用出。	but when he tried to straighten himself up and get to his feet, he felt a sudden numbness in the small of his back. Misty had beaten him to it! He had pressed on exactly the spot Old Hai had been trying to teach him the previous evening.
韦小宝挣了几下，始终难以挣脱，只得叫道：“好，降你一次！”	After struggling futilely for a moment longer, he finally gave up. 'All right!' he cried. This time I surrender!'
小玄子哈哈大笑，放了他起身。	Misty laughed and set him free.
韦小宝突然伸足绊去，小玄子斜身欲跌，韦小宝顺手出拳，正中他腰间。	As Trinket got up, he suddenly shot out one of his feet. Misty toppled over, and Trinket punched him in the small of the back.
小玄子痛哼一声，弯下腰来，韦小宝自后扑上，双手箍住他头颈两侧。	Misty gave a cry of pain and bent double. Trinket leapt on him from behind and gripped him tightly round the throat with both his hands.
小玄子一阵晕眩，伏倒在地。	Misty lost consciousness for an instant, and fell flat on the ground.
韦小宝大喜，双手紧箍不放，问道：“投不投降？”	Trinket held on and demanded triumphantly: 'Surrender?'
小玄子哼了一声，突然间双肋向后力撞。 韦小宝胸口肋骨痛得便欲折断，大叫一声，仰天倒下。	Misty gave a little grunt. Then suddenly he drove his elbows hard into Trinket's ribs, and Trinket went reeling over on to the floor, screaming with pain, certain that he must have several broken bones.
小玄子翻身坐在他胸口，这一回合又是胜了，只是气喘吁吁，也已累得上气不接下气，问道：“服…… 服…… 服了没有？”	Misty spun round and sat astride his chest, once more the victor, though this time a winded and exhausted one, panting for breath. 'Do . . . you . . . give in?'
韦小宝道：“服个屁！	'Give in my arse!' panted Trinket back.
不…… 服，一百个…… 一…… 一万个不服。	The answer's no! A hundred times no!
你不过碰巧赢了。”	You were lucky just now, that's all!'
小玄子道：“你不服，便…… 便起来打过。”	'Then get up ... and fight!'
韦小宝双手撑地，只想使劲弹起来，但胸口要害处给对手按住了，什么力气都使不出来，僵持良久，只得又投降一次。	Trinket stretched and heaved with all his might (what little of it he had left), but his opponent was still astride his aching ribs, and his efforts were to no avail. After several more minutes of futile struggle, he surrendered yet again.
小玄子站起身来，只觉双臂酸软。	Misty rose to his feet. His arms were sore and limp with exhaustion.
韦小宝勉力站起，身子摇摇摆摆，说道：“明儿…… 明儿再来打过，非…… 非叫你投降不可。”	Trinket staggered to his feet and took a few tottering steps across the room. 'Tomorrow . . . tomorrow I'll take you on again . . . and I'll beat you for sure!'
小玄子笑道：“再打一百次，你也…… 也…… 也是个输，你有胆子，明天就再来打。”	Misty laughed. 'If we fight a hundred times, you'll. . . you'll always lose! If you've got the guts, come again tomorrow!'
韦小宝道：“只怕你没胆子呢，我为什么没胆子？	'You're probably the one who's not got the guts! I'm not afraid.
死约会，不见不散。”	Live or die! My word is my wand!'
小玄子道：“好，死约会，不见不散。” 两人打得兴起，都不提赌银子的事。	They had both been quite carried away by the fighting, and neither of them had mentioned the money, or the bet they had laid.
小玄子既然不提，韦小宝乐得假装忘记，倘若是他赢了，银子自然非要不可。	Or to be strictly accurate, Misty didn't mention it, and since he didn't, Trinket was more than happy to pretend to have forgotten. If he had emerged the victor, it would have been a very different story.
