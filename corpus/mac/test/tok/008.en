return to the imperial kitchen from he duty with kang xi in the upper library , trinket do not have long to wait for butcher qian 's arrival .
this time the butcher have four assistant with he , carry between they the neatly butcher , immaculately clean carcass of two large , fat pig , each , at a rough estimate , represent not less than three hundred catty of pork .
' laurie goong-goong , ' he tell trinket , ' to get the most value out of this china-root pork , you want to eat some each day , as soon as you get up in the morning .
it be best if you cut only as much as you need at one time and roast it straight away .
i 'll have one of these pig carry to you quarter now .
you 'll be able to cut some off yourself and roast it first thing tomorrow .
what you can not eat yourself you can get the folk in the kitchen here to make salt pork of . '
realize that there must be some hidden purpose behind all this , trinket thank he for the advice and offer to show he the way , whereupon butcher qian , leave one of the carcass and its two bearer in the kitchen , accompany he to he room , follow by the other two assistant carry the second pig .
the manager 's quarter in the imperial catering department be not very far from the imperial kitchen .
as soon as they be inside , trinket order a young eunuch to take the two assistant back to the kitchen , with instruction that they be to wait for they master there with the other two , and close the door after they .
' master , ' say butcher qian , speak in a low voice , ' be there anyone else in this apartment ? '
see trinket shake he head , he crouch down over the pig 's carcass and gently turn it on its back again so that its leg be point upward .
it be now possible to see that the slit-open underbelly of the animal have be draw together and be be hold in place by strip of pig-skin sewn across the slit .
it be obvious that something very out of the ordinary must be conceal inside .
trinket could feel he heart thump as he reflect that this might well be weapon which the triads be smuggling in to be use in a killing spree inside the palace .
he watch as butcher qian tear off the strip , open out the carcass , and very gently lift a large object out in he cradle arm .
' coo ! ' he gasp .
it be a human body .
butcher qian lay the body on the floor .
it be small and slight with a abundance of hair .
to he astonishment trinket find himself look down at a thirteen - or fourteen-year-old girl .
she be dress in the flimsiest of summer garment , she eye be tightly close , and she body be completely motionless except for the gentle rise and fall of she breathing .
' who be this girl ? ' he ask softly .
' why have you bring she here ? '
' she be the little countess , ' say butcher qian .
the mu family 's little countess . '
trinket 's eye grow round with astonishment .
' the mu family 's little countess ? '
' young lord mu 's little sister , ' say butcher qian .
the mu have kidnap we brother xu , so we have grab she as a hostage , just to make sure they do not do brother xu any harm . '
' brilliant ! ' say trinket , he surprise now mix with pleasure .
' but how do you get hold of she ? '
' yesterday , after we find that brother xu have disappear , ' say butcher qian , ' while you and the other go back to willow lane , i go off on my own to make a few enquiry .
first of all i want to find out whether the mu family have any other place in the city besides the willow lane one where they might be hold he ; and secondly i want to know how many more of they there be , so that we have some idea what we be up against if it come to a fight-out .
well — huh ! — i can tell you the answer to the second question straight away .
a lot .
the young lord mu himself have come to the capital and he be bring some of they best fighting-man with he . '
trinket frown .
' tamardy !
how many triads have we get altogether in the green wood lodge ?
enough to fight they ten to one ? '
' no need for you to worry , master , ' say butcher qian .
the reason the mu family be here now be not because they want to fight we triads .
it be because the traitor wu sangui 's son , wu yingxiong , be in town . '
trinket nod .
' they have come to assassinate the little traitor , you mean ? '
' right first time , master , ' say the butcher .
' i always say you be a smart one .
as long as the old traitor and the little traitor be in yunnan , they can not touch they ; but as soon as-one of they leave yunnan , it give they a opportunity .
the only thing be , the little traitor be take no chance with he security : he be bring a whole lot of first-rate fighting-man to protect he , so they will not find it a easy job to kill he .
i find out that those mu folk do have another place in the city , but when i go to have a look there , the menfolk all seem to have go out , and there be not any sign of brother xu there either .
the only people i find there be this girl and a couple of maid look after she .
it seem too good a chance to miss , so — '
' so you go to catch a sheep , but while you be about it you think you might as well take a pig , ' say trinket , slightly reconstruct the proverb .
butcher qian laugh .
' that be about it .
although she be only a young girl , she mean all the world to the mu folk .
as long as they little countess be in we hand , brother xu will be safe as house .
there be absolutely no fear of they not look after he properly . '
' brother qian , ' say trinket admiringly , ' this be a major achievement . '
' oh , i do not know about that , ' say butcher qian coyly .
' anyway , thank you , master . '
' so now we have get this little counte , ' say trinket , ' what be we go to do with she ? '
while they be talk , he have be steal glance at the recumbent figure on the floor .
she be very beautiful — though he phrase it to himself mentally in the debased language of the brothel .
' it be a tricky business , this , ' say butcher qian .
' i be think it be one for the master himself to decide . '
' what do you think we ought to do ? '
trinket ask presently , as if he have be mull the matter over in he mind .
he have not be with the triads very long , but long enough by now to know the drill .
it be all ' master this ' and ' master that ' and respectfully wait to be tell by the master what they should do ; but invariably they have already decide what they want to do and only want the master 's approval for do it , so that if there be any question about it later , the master would have sole responsibility for what they have do .
and so he invariable response to the invariable question be to turn it back on they : ' what do you think we ought to do ? '
' well , for the present , ' say butcher qian , ' we have get to hide she somewhere safe and somewhere where the mu people can not find she .
there be a lot of they around in the capital right now , and though it be to assassinate the little traitor that they be here , now that we have kill one of they people and they have kidnap brother xu , you can be sure they be keep a close watch on anywhere in the city where there be triads .
from now on we sha not be able to take a piss or a shit without they know about it . '
trinket laugh .
here at last be someone who speak he language .
' sit down , brother qian , ' he say .
' let 's take we time over this . '
' thank you , master , ' say butcher qian , seat himself in one of the chair and continue .
' there be really two reason why i hide the little countessinside this pig 's carcass .
one be to get she past the palace guard : they always search everyone at the gate .
but it be also to get she past any of the mu family spy who might be out watch for we .
there be some really dangerous people among that mu lot , you can not afford to take any chance .
if she be hidden anywhere other than in the palace , there be no guaranteeing they would not try to get she back . '
' so you be propose to hide she in the palace ? ' say trinket .
' well , that be not really for i to say , ' say the butcher .
' it be entirely up to you , master .
mind you , look anywhere you like , you 'll never find a safer place than this .
however many of they ace fighter the mu family may have get in the city , they be not go to take on the palace guard .
not that they would ever guess she be in the palace , anyway .
but even suppose — it be very unlikely , but just suppose — they do find out she be here , they would never try get in here to rescue she .
if they could get in to do that , they could just as well get in to carry off the tartar emperor , and they have never try to do that yet because they know it be out of the question .
of course , it be rather a nerve , take it on myself to bring the little countess in here without consult you .
it mean a lot of danger for you , master .
and trouble .
i deserve to be hang . '
' you say yourself that you deserve to be hang , ' think trinket , ' but you know damn well that you will not be .
still , it do seem the best plan to hide she in here .
as he say , it be the one place they will never think of look ; and they would never be able to get she out of here , even if they do .
well , mister butcher qian , if you have the nerve to kidnap she and smuggle she into the palace , i suppose i ought to have the nerve to keep she here . '
he give the man a smile .
' it be a very good idea , ' he say .
' we 'll hide she here then . '
' if you think it be all right , i be sure it will be , ' say butcher qian .
' there be this to be say too , for hide she here .
when this business be over and the little countess be back with she own people again , it will not be any disgrace to she if they know that she be be keep all the time in the palace ; whereas if i be to keep she in the basement of my slaughterhouse — well , what with the stink of blood and offal round she all the time , it would not be very nice for a person of she quality . '
' unless you feed she on china-root and give she shaoxing wine to drink , ' say trinket mischievously .
butcher qian laugh at the interruption before continue : ' besides , although the little countess be only a girl , be a member of the fair sex it would not do much for she good name if she be keep with a lot of rough man ; whereas be keep with you , master , it will not matter . '
' why 's that ? ' say trinket in some surprise .
' well , ' say butcher qian , ' you be young too , and besides . . . besides . . . you work in the palace , so of course ...
i mean . . . it be all right . '
the butcher be clearly embarrassed , and trinket have to think for some moment before he see why .
' oh , i see .
you mean because i be a eunuch .
if i be the one guard she , it will not do any harm to she reputation .
but i be only a pretend eunuch , you know . '
it be because he be not a real eunuch that he have not grasp sooner what the embarrassed butcher be get at .
' be you bedroom in there , master ? ' ask the butcher .
trinket nod .
butcher qian take up the little countess in he arm , carry she into the bedroom , and lay she down on the bed .
there be just the one large bed there .
previously there have be a smaller one as well in which trinket use to sleep , but after the death of old hai , he have have it move out .
he have too many secret to want a young eunuch attendant living with he in he apartment .
' before i bring she in , i close the holy hall and yang cord point on she back and the pillar of heaven one on she neck so that she could not move or speak , ' say the butcher .
' if you want she to eat anything , you 'll have to open they up again ; but before you do that , i would advise you to first close the ring jump point on she leg so that she can not run away .
the mu people be all very skilled in the martial art , and though a young girl like this be not likely to know much about that sort of thing , it be not worth take any chance . '
trinket want to ask he where the holy hall and ring jump vital point be and how you close and open they ; but then he remember that , as master of the green wood lodge and a disciple of the great helmsman , he be probably expect to know about these thing and feel sure he subordinate would despise he if they find out that he be totally ignorant of these matter ; so he just nod and say that he would .
' anyway , ' he think , ' i should not have any difficulty in handle she .
she be only a girl . '
' could you lend i a knife , master ? ' say butcher qian .
trinket wonder nervously what he want it for , but stoop down nevertheless and extract the dagger from inside he boot .
butcher qian take it from he and make a incision in the back of the pig 's carcass .
unaware of the blade 's incomparable sharpness , he be somewhat surprise at the ease with which it sink in , at once bury itself up to the hilt and slice through fat and flesh as if it be bean curd .
' this be a good weapon you have get here , ' he say admiringly .
in no time at all he have cut off the two foreleg and two large collop from the back .
'' you can keep these to roast and eat yourself , master , ' he say .
the rest you can give to the little goong-goong to carry back to the kitchen .
i 'll take my leave now .
if there be any business in the society to report , i 'll let you know straight away , '
' right , ' say trinket .
he glance towards the little countess lie on the bed : ' this girl — she be sleep very soundly . '
he would want to say , ' this girl better not stay here long .
it be terribly dangerous have she here .
if anyone be to find out , i would really be in the shit , '
but then he reflect that all member of the triad society be hero who laugh at danger and would despise he if they hear he utter such craven word .
as soon as butcher qian have go back to the kitchen , trinket bar the door and check the window to make sure there be no chink or slit in the paper through which anyone could peep into the room , then , sit on the edge of the bed , he inspect the little countess .
she be stare fixedly at the top of the bedstead , and when she see trinket approach , she close she eye fast .
he laugh .
' you can not talk and you can not move !
all you can do be just lie there like a good little girl ! '
she dress be still clean , and trinket reflect that butcher qian must have do a good job of clean out the inside of the carcass .
he throw a coverlet over she .
from the snowy pallor of she cheek , drain of all they colour , and the fluttering of she long eyelash , he could tell that she be very frightened .
' do not be afraid , ' he say .
' i be not go to kill you .
just wait a few day and i 'll be set you free again . '
the little countess open she eye wide , look at he for a moment , and then quickly close they again .
trinket think of the great awe in which the mu family be hold by all the brotherhood of river and lake ; of they stuck-up henchman the elder bo — now dead , fortunately , strike down by one of he triads — and he younger brother who have rage at he and nearly break he wrist .
( the bruise be still there , he see on inspect it , and only slightly fainter . )
' and now they little countess be in my hand , ' he think .
' i can beat she and curse she as much as i want to , and she will not be able to move a muscle . '
the thought be so gratifying that it make he laugh out loud , cause the little countess to open she eye to see what he be laugh at .
' call yourself a countess , do you ? ' say trinket .
' i suppose you think you be very superior .
well , to i you be nobody . '
he grasp she right ear and give it a few pull , then he pinch she nose between finger and thumb and twist it a couple of time , laugh as he do so .
the little countess have shut she eye again , but two fat tear escape from under they lid and course down she cheek .
' do not cry ! '
trinket shout at she .
' i forbid you to cry . '
but the little countess 's tear run even faster .
' hot-piece momma ! ' say trinket exasperatedly .
' be stubborn , be we ?
open you eye and look at i , you smelly little tart ! '
but the little countess close she eye even tighter .
' huh !
think you be on you mu family estate still , do you ? ' say trinket .
think you have get you tamardy paladins to look after you ?
grandmother 's !
what be so tamardy wonderful about they ?
i tell you this : if they ever come my way , i 'll chop they into little bit , each one of they . '
no response .
' open you eye ! ' he holler at the top of he voice .
but all the little countess 's strength seem to go into close they tighter .
' all right , ' he say .
' if you will not open you lousy eye , you will not be need they any more .
i might as well cut they out .
they 'll make a nice little snack for i next time i be have a drink . '
he take out he dagger and slide the flat of the blade a couple of time over she eyelid .
a shudder run through she whole body , but she still would not open she eye .
trinket be at he wit 's end to know what to do with she .
' you do not want to open you eye but i want you to open they , ' he say .
' all right , we 'll play a little game and see who come out best , the high and mighty little countess or the nasty little beggar-boy .
for the time be i be not go to cut you eye out .
i 'll cut a little turtle on you left cheek and a cow-pat on the right one .
then , when the cut have scar over and you go out into the street , people will come crowd round in thousand to gaze at the sight .
" oh , look ! " they 'll say .
" how beautiful !
the beautiful mu countess with a turtle on one cheek and a cow-pat on the other ! "
now will you open you eye ? '
the poor little countess , mistress of herself only in the ability to open or close she eye , now close they even tighter .
' i see , ' say trinket , pretend to be talk to himself .
the little tart know she be not good-looking .
she be decide she want a bit of decoration on she face to improve she look .
all right , then .
i 'll carve the turtle first . '
he take the lid off a inkstone that be on the table , ground some ink in it , and dabble the tip of a writing-brush in it until it be well soaked .
the brush , the inkstone , and the ink-stick have all be the property of old hai .
trinket have never have a writing-brush in he hand before and hold it like a chopstick .
carry it over to the bed , he proceed to draw a small turtle with it on the little countess 's left cheek .
she tear continue to flow , turn the draw into a inky streak .
' i be do the pattern with the brush first , ' he say .
' i 'll be go over it with a knife afterwards .
that be what they do when they make seal , be not it ?
ah , yes , little countess , i know what .
when the carve 's ready , i 'll be able to take you out into changan street and set up there as a print-seller .
" roll up , roll up ! "
i 'll say .
" buy a nice turtle print , three cash a sheet ! "
i 'll have you face ready paint over with black ink , then as soon as a customer give i he three cash : sheet of white paper , rub it over , peel it off , and there be a little turtle !
will not take a moment .
i ought to be able to do a hundred in a day .
that be three hundred cash .
quite a tidy little sum ! '
all the time he be gabble this nonsense , she eyelid never cease to flutter .
he could tell that she be both very angry and very frightened .
this give he great satisfaction and inspire he to further idiocy .
' hm , a cow-pat on the right cheek — no , i do not think anyone 's go to pay good money for that .
a fat pig would be better — a great big , fat , stupid-looking pig .
that would sell . '
he move round to the other side with he brush and execute a crude drawing on she right cheek : a creature with four leg and a tail which could perhaps have be a pig but might equally well have be a cat or a dog .
then he lay the brush down and take up a pair of silver-shears , the point of which he apply lightly to she left cheek .
' now , if you do not open you eye , i 'll start cut .
i 'll carve the turtle first .
the pig can wait till later . '
the little countess 's tear be now well through the closed lid in stream , but still she would not open she eye .
and since trinket be unwilling to admit defeat , there be nothing for it but to begin move the point around on she cheek .
although she have the most delicate complexion imaginable , the point be so blunt that it make not the slightest mark on she skin ; but so great be she fear , that she imagine this horrible boy really be cut pattern on she face and , from excess of emotion , she faint clean away .
trinket get a shock when he see the change that have come over she and wonder for a moment if she really have die of fright ; but when he hold he hand against she nostril , he be relieve to find that she be still breathing .
' little tart ! ' he say .
' you be only sham dead . '
it be by now obvious that she would die sooner than open she eye for he , but he be damned if he be go to admit defeat .
' as the man read the songbook while he ride he mule say , " we 'll work something out as we go along , " ' he think : ' old trink 's not go to be beat by a smelly little girl like you . '
he take a wet cloth and wipe the ink-mark from she cheek .
they come off fairly easily , reveal once more the beauty of she delicate , rather aristocratic feature .
she have fine eyebrow , long lash , a small mouth and a slightly aquiline nose .
but trinket be unimpressed .
' little countess lah-di-dah , ' he say .
' i expect you look down on a little eunuch like i .
well , i do not think much of you either , so that make we quit . '
after a while the little countess begin to regain consciousness and presently open she eye .
startle to see trinket bend over she , stare , with far from friendly eye , from barely a foot away , she quickly close they again .
trinket laugh gleefully .
' ha ha !
you have open you eye now and look at i .
i have win , admit it ! '
it be agreeable to have win , but it rather take the gloss off he victory that she could not speak .
he would have like to open the vital point that would enable she to do so , but he do not know how .
' now that you vital point be close , you can not eat , ' he say .
' if they be not open , you 'll just starve to death .
i be think of open they for you , but though i do once learn the method , it be such a long while ago that i can not remember it .
do you know how it be do ?
if you do not know , just lie there perfectly still .
if you do know , blink you eye three time . '
he watch she intently as she lay there , inert and unblinking .
after a long pause , very slowly and deliberately , she blink she eye three time .
' thank heaven for that ! ' say trinket delightedly .
' i be begin to think all of you mu people be dead from the neck up . '
he lift she up in he arm and sit she down in a chair .
' now look , ' he say , ' i be go to start point to place on you body .
if i point to the right place , blink three time ; if it be not right , just keep you eye open and do not move .
when i have find the right vital point , i 'll open it up for you .
understand ? '
the little countess blink three time .
